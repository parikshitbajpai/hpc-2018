abstract = "This paper proposes a method for a fast estimation of the largest eigenvalue of an asymmetric tridiagonal matrix. The proposed method is based on the Power method and the computation of the square of the original matrix. The matrix square is computed through a proposed fast algorithm designed specifically for tridiagonal matrices. Implementations for compressed column (CCS) and compressed row storage (CRS) formats are provided, discussed and compared to a standard scientific library. We investigate the roundoff numerical errors, showing that the proposed method provides errors no greater than the usual Power method. We provide numerical results with simulations in C/C++ implementation in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

abstract = "It has been observed that the statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of random matrices possesses universal properties, independent of the probability law of the stochastic matrix. In this article we find the correlation functions of this distribution in two classes of random Hermitian matrix models: the one-matrix model, and the two-matrix model, although it seems that the methods and conclusions presented here will allow generalization to other multi-matrix models such as the chain of matrices, or the O(n) model. We recover the universality of the two-point function in two regimes: the short distance regime when the two eigenvalues are separated by a small number of other eigenvalues, and on the other hand the long range regime, when the two eigenvalues are far away in the spectrum. In this regime we have to smooth the short scale oscillations. We also discuss the universality properties of more than two eigenvalues correlation functions."

abstract = "This paper presents a directive-based programming environment for master–slave message passing applications that enables the efficient execution of the same code on both shared and distributed memory multiprocessors. The environment exports an extension of the OpenMP workqueuing model, supports multiple levels of task parallelism and more than one master and provides transparent load balancing with a combination of static and dynamic scheduling of tasks. In addition, it operates exclusively through the available hardware on shared-memory machines and exploits MPI for explicit communication on clusters. Experimental results on a Linux-cluster demonstrate the successful combination of ease of programming with the performance of message passing."
