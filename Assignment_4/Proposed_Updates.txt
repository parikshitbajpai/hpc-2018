1) While the error handling for power method has been implemented in the present using a less sophisticated approach, the following text explains a better way to implement it.
	
	While (No. of iterations (n) < Max iterations)
		Compute new Eigenvector V(n)
		Compute the error (Error) between Eigenvector in this iteration and the previous V(n)-V(n-1)
		If (Error < Tolerance)
			Exit Loop
		Else
			Update the iteration step (n = n + 1)
		End If
	End While

	If (Error < Tolerance)
		Compute the Eigenvalue and send to master
	Else
		Generate new matrix and repeat the power iteration
	End If


2) For now the shift has been fixed to 1000d0 and it is expected to be make the code work. However, it would be better to determine the required shift a-priori using linear algebra principles or use the power iteration for a small number
   of matrices to get an expectation value of max Eigenvalues and fix the shift accordingly. This hasn't been implemented in the current code due to lack of time.
