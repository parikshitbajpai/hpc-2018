### Source Codes ###
This repository consists of the following four source codes
* matvec.f90 for double loop implementation of matrix vector multiplication. This program runs the double loop for different matrix sizes.
* matvec_omp.f90 for double loop implementation with parallelisation using OpenMP directives. The matrix size was fixed to 8192.
* matvec_BLAS.f90 for BLAS library implementation of matrix vector multiplication. The matrix size was fixed to 8192.
* matvec_omp_BLAS.f90 for BLAS library implementation with parallelisation using OpenMP directives. The matrix size was fixed to 8192.


### Shell Script ###

* The bash shell script to run all the test cases is named script.sh and can be executed using
```
	  bash ./script.sh
	  ```
